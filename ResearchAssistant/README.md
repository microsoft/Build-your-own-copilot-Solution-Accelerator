**Solution accelerator overview**

This solution accelerator is a powerful tool that helps you create your own AI assistants. The accelerator can be used by any customer looking for reusable architecture and code snippets to build AI assistants with their own enterprise data. 

It leverages Azure OpenAI Service, Azure AI Search and Microsoft Fabric, to identify relevant documents, summarize and categorize vast amounts of unstructured information, and accelerate the overall document review and content generation process. 

**Scenario**

This example focuses on a researcher who wants to explore leading flu vaccine studies and relevant grants to accelerate submission of a grant proposal. 

The assistant helps the researchers find relevant articles and grants available for their research topic easily using a conversational assistant. Researcher can generate different sections of a grant application with a simple button click, then they can refine the prompts and regenerate individual sections to add more details as needed. Finally, the generated grant application can be exported as a PDF or a Microsoft Word document for further processing.

The sample data is sourced from a select set of research published on [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), select [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/grants-funding) grant announcements and sample grant applications. The documents are intended for use as sample data only.
