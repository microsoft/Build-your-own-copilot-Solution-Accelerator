## Subscription & Access Issues

| Issue/Error Code | Description | Steps to Resolve |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **ReadOnlyDisabledSubscription** | Subscription is disabled or in read-only state | - Check if you have an active subscription before starting the deployment<br>- Depending on the type of the Azure Subscription, the expiration date might have been reached<br>- You have to activate the Azure Subscription before creating any Azure resource<br>- Refer to [Reactivate a disabled Azure subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/subscription-disabled) documentation |
| **MissingSubscriptionRegistration/<br>AllowBringYourOwnPublicIpAddress** | Required feature not registered in subscription | **Enable `AllowBringYourOwnPublicIpAddress` Feature**<br><br>Before deploying the resources, you may need to enable the **Bring Your Own Public IP Address** feature in Azure. This is required only once per subscription.<br><br>**Steps:**<br>1. Run the following command to register the feature:<br>`az feature register --namespace Microsoft.Network --name AllowBringYourOwnPublicIpAddress`<br><br>2. Wait for the registration to complete. Check the status using:<br>`az feature show --namespace Microsoft.Network --name AllowBringYourOwnPublicIpAddress --query properties.state`<br><br>3. The output should show: "Registered"<br><br>4. Once the feature is registered, refresh the provider:<br>`az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Network`<br><br>💡 Note: Feature registration may take several minutes to complete. This needs to be done only once per Azure subscription. |
| **Unauthorized - Operation cannot be completed without additional quota** | Insufficient quota for requested operation | - Check your quota usage using:<br>`az vm list-usage --location "<Location>" -o table`<br>- To request more quota refer to [VM Quota Request](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/startupsatmicrosoftblog/how-to-increase-quota-for-specific-types-of-azure-virtual-machines/3792394) |
| **CrossTenantDeploymentNotPermitted** | Deployment across different Azure AD tenants not allowed | - **Check tenant match:** Ensure your deployment identity (user/SP) and the target resource group are in the same tenant:<br>`az account show`<br>`az group show --name <RG_NAME>`<br>- **Verify pipeline/service principal:** If using CI/CD, confirm the service principal belongs to the same tenant and has permissions on the resource group<br>- **Avoid cross-tenant references:** Make sure your Bicep doesn't reference subscriptions, resource groups, or resources in another tenant<br>- **Test minimal deployment:** Deploy a simple resource to the same resource group to confirm identity and tenant are correct<br>- **Guest/external accounts:** Avoid using guest users from other tenants; use native accounts or SPs in the tenant |
| **RequestDisallowedByPolicy** | Azure Policy blocking the requested operation | - This typically indicates that an Azure Policy is preventing the requested action due to policy restrictions in your subscription<br>- For more details and guidance on resolving this issue, refer to: [RequestDisallowedByPolicy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/azure/azure-kubernetes/create-upgrade-delete/error-code-requestdisallowedbypolicy) |
| **SpecialFeatureOrQuotaIdRequired** | Subscription lacks access to specific Azure OpenAI models | This error occurs when your subscription does not have access to certain Azure OpenAI models.<br><br>**Example error message:**<br>`SpecialFeatureOrQuotaIdRequired: The current subscription does not have access to this model 'Format:OpenAI,Name:o3,Version:2025-04-16'.`<br><br>**Resolution:**<br>To gain access, submit a request using the official form:<br>👉 [Azure OpenAI Model Access Request](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUQ1VGQUEzRlBIMVU2UFlHSFpSNkpOR0paRSQlQCN0PWcu)<br><br>You'll need to use this form if you require access to the following restricted models:<br>- gpt-5<br>- o3<br>- o3-pro<br>- deep research<br>- reasoning summary<br>- gpt-image-1<br><br>Once your request is approved, redeploy your resource. |
| **ResourceProviderError** | Resource provider not registered in subscription | - This error occurs when the resource provider is not registered in your subscription<br>- To register it, refer to [Register Resource Provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/troubleshooting/error-register-resource-provider?tabs=azure-cli) documentation |

--------------------------------

## Quota & Capacity Limitations

| Issue/Error Code | Description | Steps to Resolve |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **InternalSubscriptionIsOverQuotaForSku/<br>ManagedEnvironmentProvisioningError** | Subscription quota exceeded for the requested SKU | Quotas are applied per resource group, subscriptions, accounts, and other scopes. For example, your subscription might be configured to limit the number of vCPUs for a region. If you attempt to deploy a virtual machine with more vCPUs than the permitted amount, you receive an error that the quota was exceeded.<br><br>For PowerShell, use the `Get-AzVMUsage` cmdlet to find virtual machine quotas:<br>`Get-AzVMUsage -Location "West US"`<br><br>Based on available quota you can deploy application otherwise, you can request for more quota |
| **InsufficientQuota** | Not enough quota available in subscription | - Check if you have sufficient quota available in your subscription before deployment<br>- To verify, refer to the [quota_check](../docs/QuotaCheck.md) file for details |
| **MaxNumberOfRegionalEnvironmentsInSubExceeded** | Maximum Container App Environments limit reached for region |<br>This error occurs when you attempt to create more **Azure Container App Environments** than the regional quota limit allows for your subscription. Each Azure region has a specific limit on the number of Container App Environments that can be created per subscription.<br><br>**Common Causes:**<br>- Deploying to regions with low quota limits (e.g., Sweden Central allows only 1 environment)<br>- Multiple deployments without cleaning up previous environments<br>- Exceeding the standard limit of 15 environments in most major regions<br><br>**Resolution:**<br>1. **Delete unused environments** in the target region, OR<br><br>2. **Deploy to a different region** with available capacity, OR<br><br>3. **Request quota increase** via [Azure Support](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2208872)<br><br>**Reference:**<br>- [Azure Container Apps quotas](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/quotas)<br>- [Azure subscription and service limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits) |
| **SkuNotAvailable** | Requested SKU not available in selected location or zone | - You receive this error in the following scenarios:<br>  - When the resource SKU you've selected, such as VM size, isn't available for a location or zone<br>  - If you're deploying an Azure Spot VM or Spot scale set instance, and there isn't any capacity for Azure Spot in this location. For more information, see Spot error messages |

## Resource Group & Deployment Management

| Issue/Error Code | Description | Steps to Resolve |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **ResourceGroupNotFound** | Specified resource group does not exist | **Option 1:**<br>1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home)<br>2. Click on **"Resource groups"** option<br>![alt text](../docs/images/AzureHomePage.png)<br>3. Search for the resource group in the search bar. If it exists, you can proceed<br>![alt text](../docs/images/resourcegroup1.png)<br><br>**Option 2:**<br>- This error can occur if you deploy using the same .env file from a previous deployment<br>- Create a new environment before redeploying:<br>`azd env new <env-name>` |
| **ResourceGroupBeingDeleted** | Resource group is currently being deleted | **Steps:**<br>1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home)<br>2. Go to resource group option and search for targeted resource group<br>3. If the resource group is being deleted, you cannot use it. Create a new one or use a different resource group |
| **DeploymentActive** | Another deployment is already in progress in this resource group | - This occurs when a deployment is already in progress and another deployment is triggered in the same resource group<br>- Cancel the ongoing deployment before starting a new one<br>- Do not initiate a new deployment until the previous one is completed |
| **DeploymentCanceled** | Deployment was canceled before completion | 1. **Check deployment history:**<br>   - Go to Azure Portal → Resource Group → Deployments<br>   - Review the detailed error message<br>2. **Identify the root cause:**<br>   - Dependent resource failed to deploy<br>   - Validation error occurred<br>   - Manual cancellation was triggered<br>3. **Validate template:**<br>   `az deployment group validate --resource-group <rg-name> --template-file main.bicep`<br>4. **Check resource limits/quotas**<br>5. **Fix the failed dependency**<br>6. **Retry deployment:**<br>   `az deployment group create --resource-group <rg-name> --template-file main.bicep`<br><br>💡 **Note:** DeploymentCanceled is a wrapper error — check inner errors in deployment logs |
| **DeploymentCanceled(user.canceled)** | User manually canceled the deployment | - Deployment was manually canceled by the user (Portal, CLI, or pipeline)<br>- Check deployment history and logs to confirm who/when it was canceled<br>- If accidental, retry the deployment<br>- For pipelines, ensure no automation or timeout is triggering cancellation<br>- Use deployment locks or retry logic to prevent accidental cancellations |
| **DeploymentNotFound** | Deployment record not found or was deleted | - This occurs when the user deletes a previous deployment along with the resource group, then redeploys the same RG with the same environment name but in a different location<br>- Do not change the location when redeploying a deleted RG, OR<br>- Use new names for the RG and environment during redeployment |
| **ResourceGroupDeletionTimeout** | Resource group deletion exceeded timeout limit | - Some resources may be stuck deleting or have dependencies; check RG resources and status<br>- Ensure no resource locks or Azure Policies are blocking deletion<br>- Retry deletion via CLI/PowerShell:<br>  `az group delete --name <RG_NAME> --yes --no-wait`<br>- Check Activity Log to identify failing resources<br>- Escalate to Azure Support if deletion is stuck |

--------------------------------

## Regional & Location Issues

| Issue/Error Code | Description | Steps to Resolve |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **LocationNotAvailableForResourceType** | Resource type not supported in selected region | - You may encounter a LocationNotAvailableForResourceType error if you set the secondary location to 'Australia Central' in the main.bicep file<br>- This happens because 'Australia Central' is not a supported region for that resource type<br>- Always refer to the README file or Azure documentation to check the list of supported regions<br>- Update the deployment with a valid supported region to resolve the issue |
| **InvalidResourceLocation** | Cannot change region for already deployed resources | - You may encounter an InvalidResourceLocation error if you change the region for Cosmos DB or the Storage Account (secondary location) multiple times in the main.bicep file and redeploy<br>- Azure resources like Cosmos DB and Storage Accounts do not support changing regions after deployment<br>- If you need to change the region again, first delete the existing deployment<br>- Then redeploy the resources with the updated region configuration |
| **ServiceUnavailable/ResourceNotFound** | Service unavailable or restricted in selected region | - Regions are restricted to guarantee compatibility with paired regions and replica locations for data redundancy and failover scenarios based on articles [Azure regions list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/regions-list) and [Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server - Azure Regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/overview#azure-regions)<br>- You can request more quota, refer [Quota Request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/create-support-request-quota-increase) Documentation |
| **ResourceOperationFailure/<br>ProvisioningDisabled** | Resource provisioning restricted or disabled in region | - This error occurs when provisioning of a resource is restricted in the selected region. It usually happens because the service is not available in that region or provisioning has been temporarily disabled<br>- Regions are restricted to guarantee compatibility with paired regions and replica locations for data redundancy and failover scenarios based on articles [Azure regions list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/regions-list) and [Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server - Azure Regions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/overview#azure-regions)<br>- If you need to use the same region, you can request a quota or provisioning exception. Refer [Quota Request](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/quota-increase-request) for more details |
| **RedundancyConfigurationNotAvailableInRegion** | Redundancy configuration not supported in selected region | - This issue happens when you try to create a **Storage Account** with a redundancy configuration (e.g., `Standard_GRS`) that is **not supported in the selected Azure region**<br>- Example: Creating a storage account with **GRS** in **italynorth** will fail with error `az storage account create -n mystorageacct123 -g myResourceGroup -l italynorth --sku Standard_GRS --kind StorageV2` <br>- To check supported SKUs for your region:<br>`az storage account list-skus -l italynorth -o table`<br>- Use a supported redundancy option (e.g., Standard_LRS) in the same region or deploy the Storage Account in a region that supports your chosen redundancy<br>- For more details, refer to [Azure Storage redundancy documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-redundancy?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |

--------------------------------

## Resource Naming & Validation

| Issue/Error Code | Description | Steps to Resolve |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **ResourceNameInvalid** | Resource name violates naming convention rules | - Ensure the resource name is within the allowed length and naming rules defined for that specific resource type, you can refer [Resource Naming Convention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules) document |
| **Workspace Name - InvalidParameter** | Workspace name does not meet required format | To avoid this errors in workspace ID follow below rules:<br>1. Must start and end with an alphanumeric character (letter or number)<br>2. Allowed characters: `a–z`, `0–9`, `- (hyphen)`<br>3. Cannot start or end with a hyphen -<br>4. No spaces, underscores (_), periods (.), or special characters<br>5. Must be unique within the Azure region & subscription<br>6. Length: 3–33 characters (for AML workspaces) |
| **VaultNameNotValid** | Key Vault name does not meet naming requirements | In this template Vault name will be unique everytime, but if you trying to hard code the name then please make sure below points:<br>1. Check name length - Ensure the Key Vault name is between 3 and 24 characters<br>2. Validate allowed characters - The name can only contain letters (a–z, A–Z) and numbers (0–9). Hyphens are allowed, but not at the beginning or end, and not consecutive (--)<br>3. Ensure proper start and end - The name must start with a letter. The name must end with a letter or digit (not a hyphen)<br>4. Test with a new name - Example of a valid vault name: ✅ `cartersaikeyvault1`, ✅ `securevaultdemo`, ✅ `kv-project123` |
| **BadRequest: Dns record under zone Document is already taken** | DNS record name already in use | This error can occur only when user hardcoding the CosmosDB Service name. To avoid this you can try few below suggestions:<br>- Verify resource names are globally unique<br>- If you already created an account/resource with same name in another subscription or resource group, check and delete it before reusing the name<br>- By default in this template we are using unique prefix with every resource/account name to avoid this kind for errors |

---------------------------------

## Resource Identification & References

| Issue/Error Code | Description | Steps to Resolve |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **LinkedInvalidPropertyId/ ResourceNotFound/DeploymentOutputEvaluationFailed/ CanNotRestoreANonExistingResource / The language expression property array index is out of bounds** | Invalid or non-existent resource ID reference | - Before using any resource ID, ensure it follows the correct format<br>- Verify that the resource ID you are passing actually exists<br>- Make sure there are no typos in the resource ID<br>- Verify that the provisioning state of the existing resource is `Succeeded` by running the following command to avoid this error while deployment or restoring the resource:<br>`az resource show --ids <Resource ID> --query "properties.provisioningState"`<br>- Sample Resource IDs format:<br>  - Log Analytics Workspace Resource ID: `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{workspaceName}`<br>  - Azure AI Foundry Project Resource ID: `/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{name}`<br>- You may encounter the error `The language expression property array index '8' is out of bounds` if the resource ID is incomplete. Please ensure your resource ID is correct and contains all required information, as shown in sample resource IDs<br>- For more information refer [Resource Not Found errors solutions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/troubleshooting/error-not-found?tabs=bicep) |
| **ParentResourceNotFound** | Parent resource does not exist or cannot be found | - You can refer to the [Parent Resource Not found](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/troubleshooting/error-parent-resource?tabs=bicep) documentation if you encounter this error |
| **PrincipalNotFound** | Principal ID does not exist in Azure AD tenant | - This error occurs when the **principal ID** (Service Principal, User, or Group) specified in a role assignment or deployment does not exist in the Azure Active Directory tenant<br>- It can also happen due to **replication delays** right after creating a new principal<br>**Example causes:**<br>- The specified **Object ID** is invalid or belongs to another tenant<br>- The principal was recently created but Azure AD has not yet replicated it<br>- Attempting to assign a role to a non-existing or deleted Service Principal/User/Group<br>**How to fix:**<br>1. Verify that the **principal ID is correct** and exists in the same directory/tenant: `az ad sp show --id <object-id>`<br>2. If the principal was just created, wait a few minutes and retry<br>3. Explicitly set the principalType property (ServicePrincipal, User, or Group) in your ARM/Bicep template to avoid replication delays<br>4. If the principal does not exist, create it again before assigning roles<br>- For more details, see [Azure PrincipalType documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/troubleshooting?tabs=bicep) |
| **SubscriptionDoesNotHaveServer** | Referenced SQL Server does not exist in subscription | - This issue happens when you try to reference an **Azure SQL Server** (`Microsoft.Sql/servers`) that does not exist in the selected subscription<br>- It can occur if: The SQL server name is typed incorrectly; The SQL server was **deleted** but is still being referenced; You are working in the **wrong subscription context**; The server exists in a **different subscription/tenant** where you don't have access<br>**Reproduce:**<br>Run an Azure CLI command with a non-existent server name:<br>`az sql db list --server sql-doesnotexist --resource-group myResourceGroup`<br>or<br>`az sql server show --name sql-caqfrhxr4i3hyj --resource-group myResourceGroup`<br>**Resolution:**<br>- Verify the SQL Server name exists in your subscription: `az sql server list --output table`<br>- Make sure you are targeting the correct subscription:<br>`az account show`<br>`az account set --subscription <subscription-id>`<br>- If the server was deleted, either restore it (if possible) or update references to use a valid existing server |

---------------------------------

## Network & Infrastructure Configuration

| Issue/Error Code | Description | Steps to Resolve |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **NetcfgSubnetRangeOutsideVnet** | Subnet IP range outside virtual network address space | - Ensure the subnet's IP address range falls within the virtual network's address space<br>- Always validate that the subnet CIDR block is a subset of the VNet range<br>- For Azure Bastion, the AzureBastionSubnet must be at least /27<br>- Confirm that the AzureBastionSubnet is deployed inside the VNet |
| **DisableExport_PublicNetworkAccessMustBeDisabled** | Public network access must be disabled when export is disabled | - **Check container source:** Confirm whether the deployment is using a Docker image or Azure Container Registry (ACR)<br>- **Verify ACR configuration:** If ACR is included, review its settings to ensure they comply with Azure requirements<br>- **Check export settings:** If export is disabled in ACR, make sure public network access is also disabled<br>- **Redeploy after fix:** Correct the configuration and redeploy. This will prevent the Conflict error during deployment<br>- For more information refer [ACR Data Loss Prevention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/data-loss-prevention) document |

---------------------------------

## Configuration & Property Errors

| Issue/Error Code | Description | Steps to Resolve |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **InvalidRequestContent** | Deployment contains unrecognized or missing required values | - The deployment values either include values that aren't recognized, or required values are missing. Confirm the values for your resource type<br>- You can refer [Invalid Request Content error](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/troubleshooting/common-deployment-errors#:~:text=InvalidRequestContent,Template%20reference) documentation |
| **Conflict - Cannot use the SKU Basic with File Change Audit for site** | File Change Audit not supported on Basic SKU | - This error happens because File Change Audit logs aren't supported on Basic SKU App Service Plans<br>- Upgrading to Premium/Isolated SKU (supports File Change Audit), or<br>- Disabling File Change Audit in Diagnostic Settings if you must stay on Basic<br>- Always cross-check the [supported log types](https://aka.ms/supported-log-types) before adding diagnostic logs to your Bicep templates |
| **AccountPropertyCannotBeUpdated** | Read-only property cannot be modified after creation | - The property **`isHnsEnabled`** (Hierarchical Namespace for Data Lake Gen2) is **read-only** and can only be set during **storage account creation**<br>- Once a storage account is created, this property **cannot be updated**<br>- Trying to update it via ARM template, Bicep, CLI, or Portal will fail<br>**Resolution:**<br>- Create a **new storage account** with `isHnsEnabled=true` if you require hierarchical namespace<br>- Migration may be needed if you already have data<br>- Refer to [Storage Account Update Restrictions](https://aka.ms/storageaccountupdate) for more details |


----------------------------------

## Resource State & Provisioning

| Issue/Error Code | Description | Steps to Resolve |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **AccountProvisioningStateInvalid** | Resource used before provisioning completed | - The AccountProvisioningStateInvalid error occurs when you try to use resources while they are still in the Accepted provisioning state<br>- This means the deployment has not yet fully completed<br>- To avoid this error, wait until the provisioning state changes to Succeeded<br>- Only use the resources once the deployment is fully completed |
| **BadRequest - DatabaseAccount is in a failed provisioning state because the previous attempt to create it was not successful** | Database account failed to provision previously | - This error occurs when a user attempts to redeploy a resource that previously failed to provision<br>- To resolve the issue, delete the failed deployment first, then start a new deployment<br>- For guidance on deleting a resource from a Resource Group, refer to the following link: [Delete an Azure Cosmos DB account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/manage-with-powershell#delete-account:~:text=%3A%24enableMultiMaster-,Delete%20an%20Azure%20Cosmos%20DB%20account,-This%20command%20deletes) |

---------------------------------

## Miscellaneous

| Issue/Error Code | Description | Steps to Resolve |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **DeploymentModelNotSupported/<br>ServiceModelDeprecated/InvalidResourceProperties** | Model not supported or deprecated in selected region | - The updated model may not be supported in the selected region. Please verify its availability in the [Azure AI Foundry models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/concepts/models?tabs=global-standard%2Cstandard-chat-completions) document |
| **FlagMustBeSetForRestore/<br>NameUnavailable/CustomDomainInUse** | Soft-deleted resource requires restore flag or purge | - This error occurs when you try to deploy a Cognitive Services resource that was **soft-deleted** earlier<br>- Azure requires you to explicitly set the **`restore` flag** to `true` if you want to recover the soft-deleted resource<br>- If you don't want to restore the resource, you must **purge the deleted resource** first before redeploying<br>**Example causes:**<br>- Trying to redeploy a Cognitive Services account with the same name as a previously deleted one<br>- The deleted resource still exists in a **soft-delete retention state**<br>**How to fix:**<br>1. If you want to restore → add `"restore": true` in your template properties<br>2. If you want a fresh deployment → purge the resource using: `az cognitiveservices account purge --name <resource-name> --resource-group <resource-group> --location <location>`<br>- For more details, refer to [Soft delete and resource restore](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/delete-resource-group?tabs=azure-powershell) |
| **ContainerAppOperationError** | Container image build or deployment issue | - The error is likely due to an improperly built container image. For resolution steps, refer to the [Azure Container Registry (ACR) – Build & Push Guide](./ACRBuildAndPushGuide.md) |
