## Azure account setup

1. Sign up for a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) and create an Azure Subscription.
2. Check that you have the necessary permissions:
    * Your Azure account must have `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write` permissions, such as [Role Based Access Control Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#role-based-access-control-administrator-preview), [User Access Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator), or [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner).
    * Your Azure account also needs `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` permissions on the subscription level.

You can view the permissions for your account and subscription by following the steps below: 
- Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and click on `Subscriptions` under 'Navigation' 
- Select the subscription you are using for this accelerator from the list. 
    - If you try to search for your subscription and it does not come up, make sure no filters are selected.
- Select `Access control (IAM)` and you can see the roles that are assigned to your account for this subscription. 
    - If you want to see more information about the roles, you can go to the `Role assignments`
     tab and search by your account name and then click the role you want to view more information about.
