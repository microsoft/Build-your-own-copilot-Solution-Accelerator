### 3. Navigate to Projects under Resource Management
On the left sidebar of the Foundry service blade:

- Expand the Resource Management section
- Click on Projects (this refers to the active Foundry project tied to the service)

### 4. Click on the Project
From the Projects view: Click on the project name to open its details

    Note: You will see only one project listed here, as each Foundry service maps to a single project in this accelerator
