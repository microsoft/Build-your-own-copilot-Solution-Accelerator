# Deployment Guide 

## **Pre-requisites**

To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create **resource groups, resources, and assign roles at the resource group level***. Follow the steps in  [Azure Account Set Up](AzureAccountSetUp.md) 

Check the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/table) page and select a **region** where the following services are available: 

- [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/) 
- [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/) 
- [Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/)
- [Azure SQL Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/)
- [Azure Semantic Search](AzureSemanticSearchRegion.md)  

Here are some example regions where the services are available: East US, East US2, Australia East, UK South, France Central.

### [Optional] Quota Recommendations  
By default, the **Gpt-4o-mini model capacity** in deployment is set to **30k tokens**, so we recommend updating the following:

> **For Global Standard | GPT-4o-mini - increase the capacity to at least 150k tokens post-deployment for optimal performance.**

Depending on your subscription quota and capacity, you can [adjust quota settings](AzureGPTQuotaSettings.md) to better meet your specific needs. You can also [adjust the deployment parameters](CustomizingAzdParameters.md) for additional optimization.

## Deployment Options

### Sandbox or WAF Aligned Deployment Options

The [`infra`](../infra) folder of the Build-your-own-copilot-Solution-Accelerator contains the [`main.bicep`](../infra/main.bicep) Bicep script, which defines all Azure infrastructure components for this solution.

By default, the `azd up` command uses the [`main.parameters.json`](../infra/main.parameters.json) file to deploy the solution. This file is pre-configured for a **sandbox environment** — ideal for development and proof-of-concept scenarios, with minimal security and cost controls for rapid iteration.

For **production deployments**, the repository also provides [`main.waf.parameters.json`](../infra/main.waf.parameters.json), which applies a [Well-Architected Framework (WAF) aligned](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/) configuration. This option enables additional Azure best practices for reliability, security, cost optimization, operational excellence, and performance efficiency, such as:

  - Enhanced network security (e.g., Network protection with private endpoints)
  - Stricter access controls and managed identities
  - Logging, monitoring, and diagnostics enabled by default
  - Resource tagging and cost management recommendations

**How to choose your deployment configuration:**

* Use the default `main.parameters.json` file for a **sandbox/dev environment**
* For a **WAF-aligned, production-ready deployment**, copy the contents of `main.waf.parameters.json` into `main.parameters.json` before running `azd up`

---

### VM Credentials Configuration

By default, the solution sets the VM administrator username and password from environment variables.

To set your own VM credentials before deployment, use:

```sh
azd env set AZURE_ENV_VM_ADMIN_USERNAME <your-username>
azd env set AZURE_ENV_VM_ADMIN_PASSWORD <your-password>
```

> [!TIP]
> Always review and adjust parameter values (such as region, capacity, security settings and log analytics workspace configuration) to match your organization’s requirements before deploying. For production, ensure you have sufficient quota and follow the principle of least privilege for all identities and role assignments.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The WAF-aligned configuration is under active development. More Azure Well-Architected recommendations will be added in future updates.

### Deploying with AZD

Once you've opened the project in [Codespaces](#github-codespaces), [Dev Containers](#vs-code-dev-containers), or [locally](#local-environment), you can deploy it to Azure by following these steps:

1. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

    #### To authenticate with Azure Developer CLI (`azd`), use the following command with your **Tenant ID**:

    ```sh
    azd auth login --tenant-id <tenant-id>
    ```

    > **Note:** To retrieve the Tenant ID required for local deployment, you can go to **Tenant Properties** in [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) from the resource list. Alternatively, follow these steps:
    >
    > 1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    > 2. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** from the left-hand menu.
    > 3. Under the **Overview** section, locate the **Tenant ID** field. Copy the value displayed.

2. Provision and deploy all the resources:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```
    > **Note:** This solution accelerator requires **Azure Developer CLI (azd) version 1.18.0 or higher**. Please ensure you have the latest version installed before proceeding with deployment. [Download azd here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).

3. Provide an `azd` environment name (e.g., "byocaapp").
4. Select a subscription from your Azure account and choose a location that has quota for all the resources. 
    - This deployment will take *7-10 minutes* to provision the resources in your account and set up the solution with sample data.
    - If you encounter an error or timeout during deployment, changing the location may help, as there could be availability constraints for the resources.

5. Once the deployment is complete, please follow the [Import Sample Data](#post-deployment-steps) instructions under **Post Deployment Steps** to load the sample data correctly.
6. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to the deployed resource group, find the App Service and get the app URL from `Default domain`.
7. Test the app locally with the sample question with any selected client: _Show latest asset value by asset type?_. For more sample questions you can test in the application, see [Sample Questions](SampleQuestions.md).
8. You can now delete the resources by running `azd down`, if you are done trying out the application. 

### Publishing Local Build Container to Azure Container Registry

If you need to rebuild the source code and push the updated container to the deployed Azure Container Registry, follow these steps:

1. Set the environment variable `USE_LOCAL_BUILD` to `True`:

   - **Linux/macOS**:
     ```bash
     export USE_LOCAL_BUILD=True
     ```

   - **Windows (PowerShell)**:
     ```powershell
     $env:USE_LOCAL_BUILD = $true
     ```
2. Run the `az login` command
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

3. Run the `azd up` command again to rebuild and push the updated container:
   ```bash
   azd up
   ```

This will rebuild the source code, package it into a container, and push it to the Azure Container Registry associated with your deployment.

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting
 If you encounter any issues during the deployment process, please refer [troubleshooting](../docs/TroubleShootingSteps.md) document for detailed steps and solutions

## Deploy Your local changes
To deploy your local changes rename the below files.
   1. Rename `azure.yaml` to `azure_custom2.yaml` and `azure_custom.yaml` to `azure.yaml`.
   2. Go to `infra` directory
        - Rename `main.bicep` to `main_custom2.bicep` and `main_custom.bicep` to `main.bicep`.
Continue with the [deploying steps](#deploying-with-azd).

## Post Deployment Steps

### 1. Import Sample Data 

**Choose the appropriate command based on your deployment method:**

**If you deployed using `azd up` command:**
```bash 
bash ./infra/scripts/process_sample_data.sh 
```
> **Note**: The script will automatically take required values from your `azd` environment.

**If you deployed using custom templates, ARM/Bicep deployments, or `az deployment group` commands:**
```bash 
bash ./infra/scripts/process_sample_data.sh <your-resource-group-name>
```
> **Note**: Replace `<your-resource-group-name>` with the actual name of the resource group containing your deployed Azure resources.

> **💡 Tip**: If the deployment metadata does not exist in Azure or has been deleted, the script will prompt you to manually enter the required configuration values.

> **💡 Tip**: Since this guide is for azd deployment, you'll most likely use the first command without resource group name.

### 2. Configure Authentication

Follow the steps in [App Authentication](./AppAuthentication.md) to configure authentication in App Service. 

> **Note**: Authentication changes can take up to 10 minutes to propagate.

### 3. Troubleshooting: Cleaning Up After a Failed Deployment

If your deployment fails and you need to clean up resources, follow the steps in [Delete Resource Group](./DeleteResourceGroup.md).

## Environment configuration for local development & debugging
> Set APP_ENV in your .env file to control Azure authentication. Set the environment variable to dev to use Azure CLI credentials, or to prod to use Managed Identity for production. **Ensure you're logged in via az login when using dev in local**.

To configure your environment, follow these steps:

	1. Navigate to the `src\App` folder.
	2. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.sample` file.
	3. Fill in the `.env` file using the deployment output or by retrieving values from the Azure Portal under "Deployments" in your resource group.
	4. Ensure that the `APP_ENV` variable is set to "**dev**".
