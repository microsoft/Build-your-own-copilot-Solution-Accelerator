# AI Foundry Deployment Guide 

> **Important**: For WAF-aligned production deployments, ensure you are logged into the designated virtual machine before proceeding with the below steps.

### Accessing the Virtual Machine via Azure Bastion

For WAF-aligned production environments, you must perform these deployment steps from within the designated virtual machine. Follow these steps to connect:

1. **Navigate to your Virtual Machine in Azure Portal**
   - Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
   - Search for "Virtual machines" in the top search bar
   - Click on your VM named `vm-{your-deployment-prefix}` or similar

2. **Connect using Azure Bastion**
   - In your VM overview page, click the **Connect** button
   - Select **Connect via Bastion** from the dropdown menu

3. **Enter your credentials**
   - **Username**: Use the admin username you specified during the initial deployment (e.g., `JumpboxAdminUser` or the custom username you provided)
   - **Password**: Enter the admin password you set during the deployment process
   - **Authentication Type**: Select "Password" 
   - Click **Connect**

4. **Wait for connection**
   - The Bastion connection may take 30-60 seconds to establish
   - A new browser tab will open with your VM desktop environment

5. **Open a web browser in the VM**
   - Once connected to the VM, open Microsoft Edge or Chrome
   - Navigate to [AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/) from within the VM
   - Sign in with your Azure credentials

> **Troubleshooting**: If you forgot your VM credentials:
> - You can reset the password in Azure Portal: Go to your VM â†’ **Reset password** in the left menu
> - Or contact your Azure administrator for assistance
