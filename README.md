**Solution accelerator overview**

This solution accelerator is a powerful tool that helps you create your own copilots. The accelerator can be used by any customer looking for reusable architecture and code snippets to build custom copilots with their own enterprise data. 

It leverages Azure OpenAI Service, Azure AI Search and Microsoft Fabric, to streamline daily tasks and customer meeting preparation for customer-facing roles. As a result, this helps to improve client retention and customer satisfaction. By increasing employee productivity and improving customer conversations, our solution enables organizations to serve more customers and drive increased revenue for the entire company.

**Scenario**

A Woodgrove Bank Client Advisor is preparing for upcoming client meetings. He wants insight into his scheduled client meetings, access to portfolio information, a comprehensive understanding of previous meetings, and the ability to ask questions about client’s financial details and interests. 
  
This solution with an integrated copilot helps Client Advisors to save time and prepare relevant discussion topics for scheduled meetings. It provides an overview of daily client meetings with seamless navigation between viewing client profiles and chatting with data. Altogether, these features streamline meeting preparation for client advisors and result in more productive conversations with clients. 

The sample data used in this repository is synthetic and generated using Azure OpenAI service. The data is intended for use as sample data only.

QUICK DEPLOY
</h2>

### Prerequisites

To deploy this solution accelerator, ensure you have access to an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) with the necessary permissions to create **resource groups and resources**. Follow the steps in  [Azure Account Set Up](./docs/AzureAccountSetUp.md) 

Check the [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/table) page and select a **region** where the following services are available: 

- [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/) 
- [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/) 
- [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/)
- [Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/)
- [Azure SQL Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/)
- [Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/)
- [Azure Semantic Search](./docs/AzureSemanticSearchRegion.md)  

Here are some example regions where the services are available: East US, East US2, Australia East, UK South, France Central.

### ⚠️ Important: Check Azure OpenAI Quota Availability  

➡️ To ensure sufficient quota is available in your subscription, please follow **[Quota check instructions guide](./docs/quota_check.md)** before you deploy the solution.

<!-- Here are some example regions where the services are available: East US, East US2, Australia East, UK South, France Central. -->
<!-- 
| [![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2Fdocument-generation-solution-accelerator%2Fmain%2Finfra%2Fmain.json) |

### Configurable Deployment Settings

When you start the deployment, most parameters will have **default values**, but you can update the below settings by following the steps  [here](./docs/CustomizingAzdParameters.md):  

| **Setting** | **Description** |  **Default value** |
|------------|----------------|  ------------|
| **Azure OpenAI Location** | The region where OpenAI deploys | eastus2 | 
| **Environment Name** | A **3-20 character alphanumeric value** used to generate a unique ID to prefix the resources. |  byocatemplate |
| **Cosmos Location** | A **less busy** region for **CosmosDB**, useful in case of availability constraints. |  eastus2 |
| **Deployment Type** | Select from a drop-down list. |  Global Standard |
| **GPT Model** | OpenAI GPT model  | gpt-4o-mini |  
| **GPT Model Deployment Capacity** | Configure capacity for **GPT models**. | 30k |
| **Embedding Model** | OpenAI embedding model |  text-embedding-ada-002 |
| **Embedding Model Capacity** | Set the capacity for **embedding models**. |  80k |


### [Optional] Quota Recommendations  
By default, the **Gpt-4o-mini model capacity** in deployment is set to **30k tokens**, so we recommend

<!-- **For Global Standard | GPT-4o-mini - the capacity to at least 150k tokens post-deployment for optimal performance.** -->

To adjust quota settings, follow these [steps](./docs/AzureGPTQuotaSettings.md)  

### Deploying

To change the azd parameters from the default values, follow the steps [here](./docs/CustomizingAzdParameters.md). 


1. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

    #### To authenticate with Azure Developer CLI (`azd`), use the following command with your **Tenant ID**:

    ```sh
    azd auth login --tenant-id <tenant-id>
   ```

2. Provision and deploy all the resources:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

3. Provide an `azd` environment name (like "byocaapp")
4. Select a subscription from your Azure account, and select a location which has quota for all the resources. 
    * This deployment will take *7-10 minutes* to provision the resources in your account and set up the solution with sample data. 
    * If you get an error or timeout with deployment, changing the location can help, as there may be availability constraints for the resources.

5. Once the deployment has completed successfully and you would like to use the sample data, run the bash command printed in the terminal. The bash command will look like the following: 
    ```shell 
    bash ./infra/scripts/process_sample_data.sh
    ```

6. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to the deployed resource group, find the App Service and get the app URL from `Default domain`.
7. Test the app locally with the sample question with any selected client: _Show latest asset value by asset type?_. For more sample questions you can test in the application, see [Sample Questions](./docs/SampleQuestions.md).
8. You can now delete the resources by running `azd down`, if you are done trying out the application. 

### **How to install/deploy**

1. Please check the link [Azure Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=all&regions=all) and choose a region where Azure AI Search, Semantic Ranker, Azure OpenAI Service, and Azure AI Foundry are available. 

2. Click the following deployment button to create the required resources for this accelerator in your Azure Subscription.
