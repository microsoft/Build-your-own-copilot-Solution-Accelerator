**Solution accelerator overview**

This solution accelerator is a powerful tool that helps you create your own copilots. The accelerator can be used by any customer looking for reusable architecture and code snippets to build custom copilots with their own enterprise data. 

It leverages Azure OpenAI Service, Azure AI Search and Microsoft Fabric, to streamline daily tasks and customer meeting preparation for customer-facing roles. As a result, this helps to improve client retention and customer satisfaction. By increasing employee productivity and improving customer conversations, our solution enables organizations to serve more customers and drive increased revenue for the entire company.

**Use Case / Scenario**

A Woodgrove Bank Client Advisor is preparing for upcoming client meetings. He wants insight into his scheduled client meetings, access to portfolio information, a comprehensive understanding of previous meetings, and the ability to ask questions about client’s financial details and interests. 
  
This solution with an integrated copilot helps Client Advisors to save time and prepare relevant discussion topics for scheduled meetings. It provides an overview of daily client meetings with seamless navigation between viewing client profiles and chatting with data. Altogether, these features streamline meeting preparation for client advisors and result in more productive conversations with clients. 

The sample data used in this repository is synthetic and generated using Azure OpenAI service. The data is intended for use as sample data only.

### Costs

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers.
However, Azure Container Registry has a fixed cost per registry per day.

* Azure AI Foundry: Free tier. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ai-studio/)
    * Azure Storage Account for AI Foundry: Standard tier, LRS. Pricing is based on storage and operations. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/)
    * Azure Key Vault: Standard tier. Pricing is based on the number of operations. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/key-vault/)
* Azure Storage Account for Content Processing Application: Standard tier, LRS. Pricing is based on storage and operations. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/)
* Azure AI Services: S0 tier, defaults to gpt-4o-mini. Pricing is based on token count. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/)
* Azure Container App: Consumption tier with 4 CPU, 8GiB memory/storage. Pricing is based on resource allocation, and each month allows for a certain amount of free usage. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-apps/)

### Security guidelines

This template uses Azure Key Vault to store all connections to communicate between resources.

This template also uses [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for local development and deployment.

To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

* Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cloud to [secure your Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/defender-for-cloud).
* Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).
